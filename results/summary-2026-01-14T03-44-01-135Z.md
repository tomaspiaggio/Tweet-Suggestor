- **Apple Intelligence + Google Gemini** (smol.ai) - Apple is officially partnering with Google to power Siri using Gemini, signaling a major shift in the mobile AI hardware landscape. [URL](https://news.smol.ai/issues/26-01-12-gemini-apple)
- **DeepSeek Engram** (smol.ai) - DeepSeek released a new "conditional memory" lookup module that offloads static pattern retrieval to save compute for reasoning. [URL](https://news.smol.ai/issues/26-01-12-gemini-apple)
- **Vercel Markdown Docs** (Twitter) - Vercel now supports fetching documentation in markdown via curl, making it significantly more token-efficient for coding agents like Claude Code. [URL](https://x.com/rauchg/status/2011152152623005736)
- **Meta Acquires Manus** (smol.ai) - Meta reportedly acquired agent startup Manus for $4B after they hit $100M ARR in just 9 months, proving the "wrapper" moat is real. [URL](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-12-30-not-much)
- **The /proc vs clock_gettime Gap** (HackerNews) - A 40-line fix in the JVM replaced procfs reads with a syscall, closing a 400x performance gap in thread timing. [URL](https://questdb.com/blog/jvm-current-thread-user-time/)
- **EP as a Scaling Lever** (vllm.ai) - vLLM is pushing 2.2k tokens/s on H200s by moving from tensor parallelism to expert parallelism for DeepSeek-style models. [URL](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/12/17/large-scale-serving.html)

## Not Tweet Worthy
- **Z.ai Launch Congrats** (Twitter) - low signal, just a congratulatory reply.
- **Python Coin Toss Logic** (HackerNews) - basic probability theory, not specifically relevant to ai advancement or sf startup culture.
- **Emacs Widget Critique** (HackerNews) - too niche/low-level for a general cto audience interested in modern stacks like nextjs.
- **Disposable Vape Tech** (HackerNews) - interesting hardware teardown but doesn't fit the ai/startup/typescript focus.
- **JPM Healthcare Conference Satire** (Owl Posting) - high word count, mostly philosophical/satirical rather than actionable news.

## Draft Tweets

**Draft 1**
apple picking gemini for siri is the ultimate validation that model orchestration is moving to the OS level

**Draft 2**
every documentation site should follow vercel and support markdown natively via curl. agents shouldn't have to parse html in 2026.

**Draft 3**
manus hitting 100m arr and getting acquired for 4b in less than a year is insane. the "it’s just a wrapper" argument is officially dead.

**Draft 4**
vllm consistently hitting 2.2k tokens/s on h200s by sharding specialists instead of weights. expert parallelism is the meta for 2026.

**Draft 5**
reminder that the biggest performance gains usually come from deleting code. replacing procfs looksups with clock_gettime for a 400x boost is a classic.
